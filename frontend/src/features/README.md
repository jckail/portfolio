## Best Practices

1. Feature Independence
   - Features should be self-contained

   - Share code through the shared directory

2. State Management
   - Use feature-specific stores
   - Keep state close to where it's used
   - Use React Context appropriately

3. Testing
   - Write unit tests for components
   - Test feature-specific logic
   - Mock external dependencies

4. Documentation
   - Document feature APIs
   - Include usage examples
   - Document state management
   - Document dependencies
