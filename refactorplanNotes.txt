Initial Project Structure Analysis:

1. Current Structure Overview:
- Main entry point: src/main.tsx
- App layer: src/app/
- Features directory: src/features/
- Shared utilities: src/shared/
- Configuration: src/config/
- Types: src/types/

2. Features Organization:
Current features:
- admin
- layouts
- resume
- telemetry
- theme

3. Initial Concerns:
a) File Organization:
- Multiple README.md files scattered across features
- Inconsistent folder structure across features
- Some empty directories (utils, hooks in several features)
- Duplicate types folders (src/types and src/shared/types)

b) Component Organization:
- Nested component folders (e.g., resume/components/main-content/main-content.tsx)
- Inconsistent component file naming (some use index.ts, others direct .tsx files)
- Mixed styling approaches (CSS files scattered across different levels)

c) Code Splitting:
- Large features like resume could potentially be split into smaller, more focused features
- Some components might be better placed in shared components

4. UI Review Observations:
a) Component Structure:
- Main layout with header navigation and side panel
- Resume sections (About Me, Technical Skills, etc.)
- Theme toggle functionality
- Social links and navigation elements

b) UI Components that could be shared:
- Skill tags/pills (used across different sections)
- Section headers
- Navigation elements
- Social media icons
- Theme toggle button

c) Feature Organization Improvements:
- Skills section could be its own feature
- Navigation could be moved to a core/navigation feature
- Social links could be part of a shared components library

5. Best Practices from Documentation:
a) Project Structure:
- Organize code within features folder
- Each feature should be self-contained
- Avoid cross-feature imports
- Use shared folders for common code
- Follow consistent folder structure within features:
  * api/
  * components/
  * hooks/
  * stores/
  * types/
  * utils/

b) Code Standards:
- Use ESLint for code quality
- Implement Prettier for consistent formatting
- Leverage TypeScript for type safety
- Use absolute imports
- Follow consistent file naming (kebab-case)
- Avoid barrel files (index.ts exports)

6. Potential Improvements:
- Standardize feature folder structure
- Consolidate types into a single location
- Implement consistent file naming conventions
- Better organization of styles
- Clear separation of concerns between features
- Move reusable components to shared
- Implement proper code splitting
- Create dedicated features for major sections
- Implement atomic design principles for components
- Add proper ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Enforce TypeScript usage across the project
- Configure absolute imports

Next Steps:
1. Create comprehensive refactor plan
2. Detail step-by-step implementation approach
3. Prioritize changes based on impact and complexity
