I'm a data engineer with a deep curiosity for technology, always excited to explore AI, machine learning, and data systems. I've helped build efficient, scalable systems, developed complex pipelines, and worked with transformer models.

I love collaborating with others to create technology that makes a real impact. When I'm not working, you'll likely find me building computers, hiking with my dog in the mountains, or experimenting with new machine learning tools.

For me, the goal is simple:
"Make the world work better, one datasetâ€”and adventureâ€”at a time."
